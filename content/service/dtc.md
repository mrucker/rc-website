The DTC is a one stop shop for researchers conducting experiments with modern wearables, smartwatches, smartphones, and IoT devices. The DTC exists to make it faster, easier, and more affordable to use modern consumer devices in research. Whether you're just getting started with devices/apps in your research or have a long track record, the DTC can meet you where you're at and provide the services you need.

# What can the Digital Technology Core do for me?
The DTC understands different teams have different needs. We are open to working with you in the way that is best for you. Below is a list of some of the ways we've worked with teams in the past. If one of these sound like what you're looking for please contact us.
* Create smartphone apps to collect data, share content, and intervene to change behavior
* Collect and act on data from multiple devices (e.g., Oura ring, Whoop band, and Smartphone)
* Utilize a secure cloud where you can safely send data from IoT devices and wearables in real time
* Brainstorm ideas within the digital technology space (we love to help you formulate your ideas)

# Isn't building an app time consuming and expensive?
Traditionally, yes, but the DTC offers a model that we call "hosted" apps, which can be built faster and more cheaply than traditional apps. A "hosted" app is in between building an app from scratch and using someone else's app. If your goal is to run a research study, a "hosted" app will do everything you want. If your goal is to eventually have your own stand-alone app, think of a "hosted" app as an affordable prototype. The hosted approach has many benefits for you:
* Maintenance costs are minimized due to a shared infrastructure
* New features are available for free due to a shared infrastructure
* App store review and approval processes are avoided
* Updates to your app can be released in a matter of minutes
* Your app will be available on both iOS and Android without any extra work

# Can I collect data from device _____?
Probably, most modern wearable device support integration via web APIs. If a device you want to work with provides API integration (e.g., Apple Watch, Android Wear, Whoop, Oura, BioStrap, FitBit) then we can easily add it to our eco-system (if we haven't already). If you aren't sure if we support your device contact us and ask.

# What happens to data you collect for me?
All data collected by the Digital Technology Core ends up in the DTC cloud. To access your data you simply need to create an account with the DTC and then you can download your data at any time. The data we collect for you is owned by you and governed by your IRB.

# What does it cost to work with the Digital Technology Core?
The exact cost for a project is determined on a per-project basis, though in general costs come from two sources:
1. Paying to add new functionality (this is charged as hours of developer time)
2. Paying to use existing functionality (this is charged monthly to defer maintenance costs)

# Do you offer funding grants?
Yes, if you have a research idea but don't yet have grant money, you can apply for DTC funding. We call thse awards "seed "grants". The goal of DTC seed grants is to support you en-route to a larger and more competitive research grant. As such, awards are typically around $10,000, which covers adding one new feature to the DTC ecosystem and completing a study with participants. If you want to apply for a seed grant we encourage you to talk with us first. In our initial conversation we can let you know if your proposal is something the DTC could fund. For eligibility criteria and application template see [DTC seed grants](/service/dtc/grants).

# How do I include the DTC in my grant budget?
PIs may budget for DTC support in their grants. To ensure that DTC support is included in your upcoming grant proposal, we recommend that you schedule a consultation to explore the ways in which we can assist you.  Our services and resources range purchasing development time from one of our team members to providing access to our existing software infrastructure for mobile data collection.

# Do you write letters of support?
We do. If you are interested in this, please reach out to us using any of the methods on our [contact page](/service/dtc/contact). We will find a time to meet and discuss what your needs are. If we feel that your research needs are something we can help with we'll write you a letter. If we feel that we can't help with your research needs, we can probably recommend a team that can.

# What if I didn't find what I was looking for?
The DTC is just one of many research support services offered by UVA. Other services include [Research Computing](https://rc.virginia.edu), the [Data Analytics Center](/service/dac), the [Research Data Enclave](https://precisionhealth.virginia.edu/about/research-data-enclave), [UVA Qualtrics](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=ec27144cdbec53044f32fb671d96193c), and [UVA Redcap](https://redcap.healthsystem.virginia.edu/) (for researchers in the health system ).

# Ready to get started?
Contact us today using any of the methods on our [contact page](/service/dtc/contact). If you still aren't sure if the DTC can help you, please reach out anyways. Tech jargon can be hard to follow, and sometimes all you need is to talk it through.
